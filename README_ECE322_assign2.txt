In this class project in ECE 322, I utilized structs, pointers, 
and header files to organize my code and explore different data 
types. You can run the code on Visual Studios or use VMWare Fusion. 
The goal of this project is to enable an online-game called "Go Fish". 

When I did this project, some ways to help would be to first write out 
certain parts of the code in Python. Then, you can use that as a 
reference to write the code into C step-by-step. Also, understand each 
datatype carefully and make sure to know the rules of manipulating each 
specific datatype in C.
